#RTX BOT (unfinished)

short script to purchase rtx 3060 ti from newegg

code is currently not working and will never be fixed by me, however feel free to fix it if you'd like to use it.

not written to purchase different cards or to use different websites, however the code is very simple and can easily be modified to do so.

pip install nerodia, nordvpn_connect, hashlib

*if you dont want to use nord, go ahead and remove the nordvpn_connect code

download chrome web driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and add chromedriver.exe to PATH, as well as putting it in your python scripts folder

then u good enjoy get them cards, keep scorin
